# full-stack-web-development

## Instructions:
You will build another full-stack web app with Svelte and Postgres. From creating a new repository to deploying to production, every line of code is discussed. You could also try developing the code entirely in your browser using Gitpod (https://www.gitpod.io/), no need to but you could.

The technology stack for this hand-on project includes:
ðŸ’¿ Svelte (https://svelte.dev/)
ðŸ’¿ SvelteKit (https://kit.svelte.dev/)
ðŸ’¿ Prisma (https://www.prisma.io/)
ðŸ’¿ Postgres (https://www.postgresql.org/)
ðŸ’¿ Vercel (https://vercel.com/)
ðŸ’¿ Railway (https://railway.app/)


Instruction:
The students study and practice by following along with the video link below. Beware that you may need to solve several related technical issues, e.g. version compatibility issues.


- Submit your work evidence by Friday 25th February 2022 before mid night. In a pdf format, you may include screen captions of your running application, and links to your web app and coding github.

Also, be prepared to discuss in our classes the differences and similarities between technologies, e.g. Typescript vs Javascript, Svelte vs React, Postgres vs MongoDB, Serverless vs Container, API vs Event.
